# Architecture Journey

In this journey, you will look at the Lnj Merchants app architecture: its layers, key classes, and the interactions between them.

## Goals and requirements
The goals for the app architecture are:

*   Follow the [official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) as closely as possible.
*   Easy for developers to understand, nothing too experimental.
*   Support multiple developers working on the same codebase.
*   Minimize build times.

## Architecture Overview

The app architecture has three layers: a [data layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/data-layer), a [domain layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/domain-layer), and a [UI layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/ui-layer).
