Once you're up and running, you can refer to the learning journeys below to get a better
understanding of which libraries and tools are being used, the reasoning behind the approaches to
UI, architecture, and more, and how all of these different pieces of the project fit
together to create a complete app.

# Architecture

The **Lnj Merchants** app follows the
[official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) 
and is described in detail in the
[architecture learning journey](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md).


# UI
The app was designed using [Material 2 guidelines](https://m2.material.io/). Learn more about the design process and 
obtain the design files in the [Lnj Merchants App Material 2 Case Study](https://www.figma.com/file/IN2kItj0Uecjwguriit22U/LNJ---Merchant-App?type=design&mode=design&t=5RMadKxPufCaTTfp-1)).
The Screens and UI elements are built entirely using [Layouts in Views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/declaring-layout). 

The app has a single-light mode theme

Find out more about the [UI architecture here](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md#ui-layer).
